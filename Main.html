       <h3>Where We Started</h3>
       <p>First your text came a single dot nor you nor i have thought that we will reach at this stage of
        love or even we haven't thought any of it at all, we used to talk daily matters and things and
        talk goes for like 20 to 40 min and only twice in a week and yesh how can we forget text only
        on Saturday üòÇ with time the timing increases and then the love of our increase little by little
        after every talk and then our first "I Love You" text and your reply back to it after some time
        and then the Saturday only gone and we start talking every day even if it's a little and then
        our first long talks goes for 3 hours first tile till 12 i remember it clearly i said that was my
        longest talk with someone and it's you, and then that longest become normal because we
        did more and more longer after that haye those days of start tells us how far we have come
        and how far we will go how the love of ST has increased, the first "Hug" text feels so lovely
        but we both were so much shy and couldn't say it properly my word of hold instead of hug
        üòÇand then the I Love You become normal and we say it a million of times and then the Eids
        came out-</p>

          without thinking that's what i say a call and yesh how can we forget the first "Voice Note" it
          was so much amazing feeling to hear your voice first time after the school and then the talk
          became everyday routine then we said first time "Hug" and my word Hold instead of Hug and
          explaining it to you all was so much good and that shyness of our and that long Ramadan's
          Nights talk and and got very much worried when you did not came online for more then 24
          hours with very much courage texted you and Alhamdulillah your reply came üòÇand then
          your healt was not right you say and then say to me that you was the first person who got
          worried by not seeing me online ofc i was casue i only have you to talk and I l only had
